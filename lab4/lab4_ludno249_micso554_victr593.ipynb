    "Syntactic analysis, also called syntactic parsing, is the task of mapping a sentence to a formal representation of its syntactic structure. In this lab you will implement a syntactic parser that produces **dependency trees**. A dependency tree consists of directed arcs between individual words (tokens) of a sentence. To see some examples, have a look at the [Syntax: General Principles](http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/syntax.html) page of the [Universal Dependencies Project](http://universaldependencies.org/).\n",

    "#### Main parsing method\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the parsing is to tag the sentence for parts of speech. After tagging, the `parse()` method initialises a new parser configuration and asks the move classifier to predict the move that the parser should make in that configuration. It is important that this prediction is restricted to predict a valid move; this is where the optional argument of the `predict()` method in the multi-class perceptron becomes relevant (see above). Making the predicted move results in a new configuration, for which the process is iterated; this continues as long as there are valid moves left to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extract features\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference implementation extracts the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* word form of the next word to be processed\n",
    "* tag of the next word to be processed\n",
    "* word form of the topmost word on the stack\n",
    "* tag of the topmost word on the stack\n",
    "* word form of the second-topmost word on the stack\n",
    "* tag of the second-topmost word on the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "In your own implementation, make sure to handle the special cases where there are no more words left that need to be processed, or the stack is empty."
